<P ><H1>Capybaras are the largest rodents on earth. They can weigh more than 100 lbs (45 kg) and grow to be 4 feet (1.2 m) long and 2 feet (0.6 m) tall — much larger than their guinea pig relatives! They have a heavy, barrel-shaped body which sits on relatively squat legs, shorter in the front than the back.
Size
Capybaras are the world's largest rodents, weighing up to 108 pounds and growing to be 4 feet long and 2 feet tall. 
Habitat
Capybaras are semi-aquatic and live in South America near bodies of water, such as marshes, ponds, and flooded grasslands.</H1></p > 
<P><h2>Swimming
Capybaras are excellent swimmers with webbed feet that allow them to stay underwater for up to five minutes. They can also sleep underwater by keeping their nose above the water. 
Diet
Capybaras are vegetarian and eat grasses, aquatic plants, melons, grain, and squash. They also eat their own poop to absorb nutrients. 
Behavior
Capybaras are social animals that live in large herds of 10–20. They are curious and mix well with other animals. 
Reproduction
Female capybaras give birth to a single litter of 3–8 young each year after a gestation period of about 100–110 days. 
Name
The name capybara comes from the Tupi words kaá (leaf), píi (slender), ú (eat), and ara (a suffix for agent nouns), which means "one who eats slender leaves" or "grass-eater". 
Conservation status
The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources considers both capybaras and lesser capybaras to be species of least concern. </H1></P>
